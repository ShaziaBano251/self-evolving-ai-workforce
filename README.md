TCS Decode – Self Evolving AI Ready Workforce
# Self-Evolving AI Workforce Ecosystem

## Problem Statement
Employees are not AI-ready from Day 1 and struggle to continuously evolve skills in fast-changing enterprise environments.

A continuous AI feedback engine tracks work, identifies gaps, and nudges learning, creating a scalable and future-ready workforce.

- Learn-by-doing micro projects
- Continuous skill evolution engine
- AI + human feedback loop
