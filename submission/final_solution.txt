A Self-Evolving AI Workforce Ecosystem ensures employees are AI-ready from Day 1. Each employee gets an AI mentor with a role-based skill map defining required AI skills. Learning happens through real-world micro-projects evaluated by AI. A continuous feedback engine tracks work, identifies skill gaps, and nudges learning, enabling scalable and future-ready upskilling.
